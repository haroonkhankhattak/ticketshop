Should you purchase an invalid ticket or be denied access to any venue or event through the use of any of the tickets sold through the online marketplace your ticket will be protected by our money back guarantee.\n\nMost of the tickets offered on our website are rare/sold-out and/or hard to get. The ticket prices are based on supply and demand and include the service fee from sellers and our fee to make them available as well. As a result, prices are usually well above the price listed on the ticket itself (face-value).1b:T418,Here’s what we do at Live Football Tickets: \n\nWe (“LiveTix Group, S.L.”, “Live Football Tickets”, Us”) have created an online marketplace for buyers and sellers, to make hard-to-get tickets available to anyone providing quality customer service.

We provide services to both the Sellers and to you, the buyer, including marketing, search functions, logistics, and transaction services which allow you to safely and securely purchase tickets from Sellers.  \n\nTicket prices on our site are determined solely by the Sellers.

If you are based in a country in which local laws grant you a right to a refund for online purchases, you expressly acknowledge and agree that Spanish law applies to your purchase on our website, and that the law of your country of origin does not apply to this transaction. Under the extraordinarily rare circumstances in which an event is cancelled or government restrictions on stadium capacities are implemented, We will refund you the ticket purchase price, through a credit back on the payment method you have used. The service fee (variable processing \u0026 administrative expenses) will be refunded to you in the form of a voucher code, for the full value of the service fee, for future orders. This voucher will be valid for 2 years. The value of the refund is for the price of tickets and shipping only, as LiveFootballtickets.com has the right to retain its booking fee to cover variable processing and administrative expenses, as authorised under applicable laws. If an event has been cancelled and not rescheduled, you will be contacted by our customer service to arrange your refund. \n\nIn the rare event you do not receive your tickets in time for a match (for an event that is not cancelled), a full refund will be issued to you. \n\nIf the customer would like to sell the tickets that they purchased, they can contact us to do so. We will attempt to sell the tickets for them on consignment – meaning that if we can resell them – then they get their money back – but if we can’t we will return the tickets to them. \n\nIf the customer originally purchased those tickets from our website, we will attempt to resell their tickets and recover as much of the money as possible, up to the amount that they paid for them. Since consignment tickets are the customers’ property, we need the customer's direction on the price they want for their tickets. Also, in case their tickets don't sell, they must clearly tell us when they want the tickets returned to them.",

Online orders placed over the weekend or after business hours may not be processed until the next business day. \n\nThe seating charts on the site, and the specific seats and/or category are there to serve as a guide when purchasing tickets but do not guarantee exact section and/or row locations.

If an error is found while processing your order you will be notified and provided with other available seating choices and/or the option to cancel your order. Please check your tickets carefully once they arrive. If you find any discrepancies, you must let us know as soon as possible (within 48 hours) of receiving them so we can fix the situation.\n\n Tickets on the website are classified as either “unrestricted view” or “restricted view”. You agree and accept that occasionally, some objects including overhangs or pillars can partially obstruct your view (particularly in older stadiums) and that an “unrestricted view” does not always mean 100% unobstructed. Instead. “unrestricted” means that the view is not obstructed in a major way that would typically result in a ticket for this particular seat being sold at a lower price by the event organiser. \n\nWe and the Seller reserve the right to upgrade your seat(s) should the seat(s) they order become unavailable or if a Seller defaults. Tickets can however never be downgraded without consent of the buyer or at an agreed discount. The hierarchy of seats (worst to best) are as follows: Shortside Upper Tier, Shortside Lower Tier, Longside Upper Tier, Longside Lower Tier, VIP and hospitality categories (OR) Category 4, Category 3, Category 2, Category 1, VIP and hospitality (regardless of seating location).",

        "Deliveries depend on the format of the ticket. These can either be regular physical tickets or in most cases, tickets tend to be released by the clubs in an electronic configuration. The most common ticket formats nowadays are either PDF files or Mobile Tickets. \n\nELECTRONIC FORMATS \n\nPDF files are usually sent out between 24/48 hours prior to the event date for our customers to print at home at their own convenience. \n\nMobile Tickets are QR codes that are usually transferred 24/48 hours before the match and, depending on the club or federation responsible to release them, our customers may be required to download an application in order to receive them and present at the stadium gates. \n\nIn both cases, specific instructions are always emailed to the buyer depending on their ticket selection. \n\nPlease note that on rare occasions, tickets may be delivered on the day of the event. However, we guarantee that customers will receive their tickets with sufficient time to use for the event. If this happens, we will notify the buyer with specific instructions on how to access their tickets. \n\nPAPER TICKETS \n\nDeliveries are usually made via Royal Mail or FedEx International and all deliveries will require a signature, however in some circumstances the seller may require you to meet a representative at or close to the venue on the day of the match. We send you an email to let you know when your tickets are shipped and you can expect them to arrive within 48 hours (usually 1 day) if sent by Royal Mail, and 7-10 days with FedEx International Delivery. \n\nBecause football tickets are typically printed and released by the teams very close to the time of the match (often just 3 days before or on the day of the match), international delivery may not be possible and your tickets will have to be delivered locally (to your home or your hotel the day/night before the event). Please notify the hotel reception desk/concierge so they are expecting to accept the delivery on your behalf. It is your responsibility to be available to accept the delivery. You also agree to provide us with a secure delivery location and authorise anybody at that address to act on your behalf to accept delivery of the package. This is absolutely required in order for us to manage the logistics of delivery for so many fans in so many different cities. \n\nIf you have not received your tickets 24 hours before the event date, please contact us during normal business hours by email: \n\n[sales@livefootballtickets.com](mailto:sales@livefootballtickets.com) \n\nThe shipping providers do not offer any reroutes on shipped items. Therefore, the courier must deliver it to the original address on the package. If you have any specific delivery requirements, please make those arrangements when you place your order. \n\nNormally, tickets are sent to your credit card billing address. As previously mentioned, the billing address will be verified with your credit card company so you must use the exact address that your statements are sent to. \n\nIf you require the order to be sent to an alternate address, we will require a signed copy of the invoice along with legible copies of your driver's license and the credit card that was used for authorisation. This is done to protect us both against fraud. \n\nIf for any reason your tickets are returned to the seller or could not be delivered, we will attempt to contact you to arrange for another delivery attempt. If you are unavailable or refuse delivery of your tickets, the seller will place the tickets back for sale on consignment and act as your agent to attempt to recover some or all your costs. You have the right to set the asking price for your tickets, however, if no communication can be made the seller will price them appropriately in attempt to recover as much of your money as possible. In some cases, this could be substantially less than what you originally paid. At any time, you have the right to request your tickets to be sent back to you. \n\nWe cannot take responsibility under any circumstances for timely delivery of your consignment tickets.",

purposes set out in the table Purposes for which we will use your personal data above.\n\t- The following specific third parties, and related purposes:\n\t\t- Experian, a fraud-prevention agency. Experian may check the information you provide, against any particulars on any database (public or otherwise) to which Experian has access in order to carry out the relevant verification service. You can find more about Experian by visiting [this link](https://www.experian.co.uk/crain/idf-information-notice?SP_MID=15700-g\u0026SP_RID=2912776-g\u0026elqTrackId=c5834303ec214f33ab879cd1fe2d7cab\u0026elq=f19d879405b04c688dfaa129c28f0e06\u0026elqaid=15700\u0026elqat=1\u0026elqCampaignId=7265). \n\t\t- Other fraud-prevention businesses, to check the personal data which you provided and which we collected from you, for the purposes of reducing the risk of fraud and combatting fraud and criminal activity taking place on our websites;\n\t- Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. \n\n\tWe require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\n\n6. **International transfers**\n\n\tWe share your personal data within the LiveTix Group, S.L. Group. This will involve transferring your data outside Spain to our overseas offices in other EU countries.\n\n\tWhenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as Spanish, we always ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using specific standard contractual terms approved for use in the UK which give the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in the Spain, namely the International Data Transfer Agreement or  the International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses for international data transfers. To obtain a copy of these contractual safeguards, please contact us at  [security@livefootballtickets.com](mailto:security@livefootballtickets.com).\n\n\tWhenever we transfer your personal data out of Spain to service providers, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that we never transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed by Spain to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.\n\n7. **Data security**\n\n\tWe have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.\n\n8. **Data retention**\n\n\t**How long will you use my personal data for?**\n\n\tThe retention periods are listed above under “Legal basis and retention period”.\n\n\tIn some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see paragraph 9 below for further information.\n\n\tIn some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n\n9. **Your legal rights**\n  \n\tYou have a number of rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.\n\n\tYou have the right to:\n\t-   Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\t-   Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\t-   Request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n\t-   Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including carrying out profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right to object.\n\t-   You also have the absolute right to object any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (see \u003cu\u003eOPTING OUT OF MARKETING\u003c/u\u003e in paragraph 4 for details of how to object to receiving direct marketing communications).\n\t-   Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\t-   Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (see the table in section 4 for details of when we rely on your consent as the legal basis for using your data). However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\n\t-   Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in one of the following scenarios:\n\t\t-   If you want us to establish the data\'s accuracy;\n\t\t-   Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;\n\t\t-   Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or\n\t\t-   You have objected to our use of your data  but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. \n\n\tIf you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at  [security@livefootballtickets.com](mailto:security@livefootballtickets.com).\n\n\t**No fee usually required**\n\tYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\n\n\t**What we may need from you**\n\tWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\n\n\t**Time limit to respond**\n\tWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\n10. **Contact details**\n\n\tIf you have any questions about this privacy policy or about the use of your personal data or you want to exercise your privacy rights, please contact our DPO at [security@livefootballtickets.com](mailto:security@livefootballtickets.com).\n\n11. **Complaints**\n\n\tYou have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Spanish Innovation and Technology (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos), but  contact us in the first instance and give us a chance to address and complaints or concerns you have.\n\n12. **Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes**\n\n\tWe keep our privacy policy under regular review. This version was last updated on 21 January 2025. Historic versions can be obtained by contacting us at [security@livefootballtickets.com](mailto:security@livefootballtickets.com).\n\n\tIt is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us, for example a new address or email address.\n\n13. **Third-party links**\n\n\tThis website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications.

With a goal-per-game ratio of just over 0.6, Salah would need to play another 188 games to break the record at his current rate. Should he choose to see out his career at Liverpool, and avoid any serious injuries, the Egyptian icon has as good a chance as anyone of breaking Shearer’s long-standing record.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLongtime Spurs favourite Son is the next closest player to breaking the record. With 111 goals over 278 games, the Korean star’s impressive tally would mean he’d require another 378 matches to take the top spot. While the record may be slightly out of his grasp, few would bet against Son one day breaking the top 10 overall Premier League scorers, based on his current rate of scoring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite his prominence at the heart of Man Utd’s attack since 2016, Marcus Rashford’s current record of 77 goals over 249 games means he’d require another 595 games to break the record.
